## Tips and Tricks

- keep the context under control with `/compact`
- ask for simple tasks
- bear in mind that the output is being sent to LLMs
- you can ignore files with `.ignore` (by default `.gitignore` is respected)
- use `/timeline` to find previous inputs
- drafting the structure and then asking for the implementation works really well
- if the LLM failed and then solves it in the next you might want to update the
  AGENT.md with that learning.

## Ideas

1. Create agents for simple tools (druidq, trinoq, etc...)
1. Common tasks that are time-consuming but simple
1. Review my code, focusing on serious issues
1. Generate tests for my code
1. Update my README
1. Create a PR to fix this issue
1. Explore my git history to find where I introduced or deleted X
1. Compare this branch against main and give me a summary of the changes
1. Create a Mermaid diagram of this feature based on the code
1. Implement this silly feature
1. Create a CI/CD pipeline for this project
1. Add pre-commit hooks to this project
